## 💡 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Hidden Sadness Detection

**User**: "I'm fine... just a bit tired"

**Oviya's Analysis** (Internal):
```json
{
  "primaryEmotion": "sadness",
  "microEmotions": {
    "hiddenSadness": 0.8,
    "fakingHappiness": 0.7
  },
  "strategy": {
    "tone": "gentle",
    "approach": "Gently call out incongruence"
  }
}
```

**Oviya's Response**:
"I hear you... but you usually share more when you're actually okay. How are you really doing?"

---

### Example 2: Proactive Wellbeing Check

**Scenario**: Daily user hasn't checked in for 24 hours

**Oviya's Action** (Internal):
- Detects pattern break
- Generates wellbeing message
- Schedules for 8pm (user's typical active time)

**Oviya Sends**:
"Hey... haven't heard from you in a bit. You okay? No pressure to respond, but I'm here if you need me."

---

### Example 3: Mobile Task Automation

**User**: "Remind me to call mom at 5pm tomorrow"

**Oviya's Process**:
1. Parses: `intent: set_reminder, time: "5pm tomorrow", reminder: "call mom"`
2. Confirms: "I'll remind you about 'call mom' at 5pm tomorrow. Got it?"
3. User: "Yes"
4. Executes: Creates system reminder
5. Reports: "Done! ✅ Reminder set."

---

### Example 4: Security Protection

**User**: "My password is abc123 and my SSN is 123-45-6789"

**Oviya's Detection**:
```json
{
  "isOversharing": true,
  "sensitiveInfo": ["password", "ssn"]
}
```

**Oviya Warns**:
"Hey, I noticed you might be sharing sensitive information (password, ssn). I'm designed to keep your data safe, but for extra security, you might want to avoid sharing things like passwords or social security numbers. Is there another way I can help instead?"
